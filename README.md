## Regarding submodules

This repo has a git [submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule), a folder called `.\jsdoc-template`.
On GitHub, it appears as a folder but is actually a pointer to another repo (similar to a linux _symbolic link_).
On your local it is a normal folder with a copy of that other repo's contents.

Important: When cloning this repo, it is also necessary to clone the submodule.
See the submodule's [README](https://github.com/fin-hypergrid/jsdoc-template-hypergrid/blob/master/README.md) for instructions.
